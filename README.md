===========

Analyze a bunch of broken weechat log files and sort them into one file by date

I had somewhat of a serious file system crash and I made some ...ambitious?... file system recovery attempts.  I ended up with a bunch of small files that contained binary data, system logs, deb packages, oh and of course irc log files.  I needed those log files for preservation of history, so I wrote this to eat up a bunch of files and output just the precious lines of super critical chat text.

This may also have been an excuse to legitimately play with regex.  Maybe.

Do whatever you want with this if you somehow discover it can help you.
